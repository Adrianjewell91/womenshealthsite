  <header>Things you didn't know about womens' reproductive health:</header>
  <ol>

  <li>You don't have to be young to have a healthy baby. Research shows that having a baby at an older age does not prove that the baby will be unhealthy. Furthermore, the research is centuries-old, and therefore not reliable. Therefore, do not feel pressured to freeze your eggs out of fear that your baby will be unhealthy if you choose to concieve later in life.</li>

  <li>The male partner's reproductive health is just as important as the female partner's when it comes concieving a baby. For example, alcohol and drugs, and even proximity to eletronic devices, can damage sperm. Therefore, both men and womes should treat their bodies as temples, not just women.</li>

  <li>Laws that regulate the perscription of woman's birth control, as well as cultural norms, wrongfully assume that women are wholly responsible for concieving a healthy baby. The consequences are undue responsibility being placed on the female partner when it should instead be the shared with the male partner.</li>

  <li>You can conceal your identity when you are looking for institutions that provide abortions. For example, you can use the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>, which hides your identity while you surf the internet. When you use Tor, institutions that host websites cannot validate the identity of who is accessing their website, nor can your internet service provider see the websites that you are visiting. Additionally, you can use a VPN.</li>
